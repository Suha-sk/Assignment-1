# Stripe, the world's most valuable , private fintech Company.


### Overview and Origin

  In 2010, Irish entrepreneur brothers John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe initially using the name /dev/payments. "Stripe is a technology company that builds economic infrastructure for the internet. Businesses of every size—from new startups to public companies—use our software to accept payments and manage their businesses online." In March 2013, Stripe made its first acquisition, Kickoff, a chat and task-management application. In 2012, the company moved from Palo Alto to San Francisco.In October 2019, the company announced that it would be moving from the South of Market area to Oyster Point in the neighboring city of South San Francisco in 2021. 
  Dromineer looks like a picture-postcard cute Irish village – there’s a couple of low, whitewashed pubs, a few shops, two hotels serving the tourists who come for the boating and a dilapidated 11th century castle that towers over the place. The nearest main road is over five miles away. In the summer, the marina buzzes but in the winter the place is quiet. It’s the perfect setting for a Richard Curtis movie where Hugh Grant arrives, makes awkward mistakes and falls in love with a local girl.
  It’s also where Patrick and John Collison, learned to code – and where they began to think about online payments. It’s where they began laying the foundations for Stripe, their payments company valued at $20 billion when it last raised money in September 2018 and which handles payments for Amazon, Booking.com, Lyft, Deliveroo, Shopify, Salesforce and Facebook.

“To say Dromineer is rural is understating it,” John Collison explains. “We went to school about 40 minutes’ drive away and there were fewer than 20 kids in each class.” The brothers found school boring. Their father, Denis, trained as an electronic engineer and mother, Lily, as a microbiologist, and the technical chat round the family table outstripped anything they learned in class. They were fascinated by maths and physics. By their early teens they had nine computers at home and were paying €100 a month for a satellite broadband link via Germany.

In 2007, when the brothers were coding their APIs, online payments were supposed to have been solved. In 2008, Patrick and John sold Auctomatic to Canada’s Live Current Media for $5 million – making them teenage millionaires – then went back to university, MIT and Harvard respectively. They began tinkering with the idea of focusing on software developers – the people actually building the sites and apps. They came up with seven simple lines of code that anyone could insert into any app or website in a day to connect to a payments company. A process that used to take weeks was now a cut-and-paste job.


In 2010, the brothers dropped out of college and launched Stripe in San Francisco with seed funding from accelerator Y Combinator. The company offered seven lines of code and a promise that no other changes were needed. Developers who integrated the Stripe API wouldn’t have to touch it for years. In the early days, the brothers cycled to the office to save money. In 2011, they approached Peter Thiel and Elon Musk.


## Business Activities

### Technology trigger

Payment Gateway application started as a solution to facilitate online payments for e-commerce industry. As a simple substitute for physical point of sale Paypal, CCBill and WorldPay were the innovators to enjoy first mover advantage. Paypal is still the largest payment gateway provider.

### Inflated expectations

Many niche players followed Paypal to have a local gateway with the same technology. These included Flattr, FastSpring, Amazon payments etc. But these lacked innovation to improve customer experience and security issues.

### Slope of Enlightenment

Many businesses are not satisfied with obsolete technology, Braintree and Stripe have taken strides to improve the present technology. Braintree initiated credit card data portability standard in 2010 and provides businesses with the ability to accept payments online or within their mobile application. Stripe with user-friendly API, security and customer service has changed the course of technology. Stripe’s software kits support Apple Pay integration in iOS apps, Bitcons and Alipay.

## MARKET ANALYSIS

![MARKET ANALYSIS](https://cdn-gcp.marutitech.com/wp-media/2019/08/9912374a-pie-chart1.png)

According to BuiltWith® Stripe has been integrated by 3,558 new websites in the year 2015. In comparison, Paypal lost 2,105 customers in the same period. Thus customer preference is gradually shifting towards Stripe, but still Paypal enjoys 91% market share (websites) in payment gateway integration. Currently, PayPal suffers from scale, age, and bureaucracy, whereas Stripe with improved technology is hustling for market share. They’re working hard to differentiate with great customer service.
